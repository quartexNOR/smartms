<div id="warleyalex"><h1>PlatformDemo</h1>
<b>Description:</b> User presses keys to control players' jumps between platforms	<br>
<b>Programmer:</b> Steven Binns	 <br>
<b>Compiler:</b> Smart Mobile Studio 2.2<br>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Introduction</h2>
<div class="p">This demonstration should help aspiring game programmers to make their own platform games. It demonstrates (using a circle for a player): 
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">object-oriented code, with classes for platforms and players;</li>

<li class="li">keyboard input for moving a player left and right and for jumping;</li>

<li class="li">collision detection, preventing players from moving through platforms;</li>

 <li class="li">gravity;</li>

<li class="li">friction, so that when left and right keys are not pressed a moving player slows to a standstill;</li>

<li class="li">the use of real numbers that can be represented exactly in binary e.g. 0.25 and 0.125.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">You will see from the code that the w, a and d keys control the blue player and the up, left and right arrows move the red player. Click on the graphics window before your first key press.</p>


<p class="p">In order to familiarise yourself with the techniques you could, for example:</p>

<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">write code to detect collisions between players and respond to these collisions;</li>

<li class="li">devise suitable positions and sizes for platforms;</li>

<li class="li">introduce a scoring system.</li>

</ul>
      
    </div>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Object-oriented code, keyboard input, Round, FillRect, Ellipse</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>This project has 3 versions.(SMS v2.0, v2.1 and v2.2). We provide the code for a single player and platform in the final section to enable you to understand the collision code more easily.</p>
