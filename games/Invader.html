<div id="warleyalex"><h1>Invader</h1>
<b>Description:</b> Including audio, mouse input, the drawing of circles and text and alpha blending <br>
<b>Programmer:</b> Steven Binns <br>
<b>Compiler:</b> Smart Mobile Studio 2.2<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> We converted Steven's popular Invader to run in Smart Mobile Studio so that you can try it on this web page. As with the original version, control the invading bug (such as a virus) with your mouse and try to survive for as long as possible by avoiding your enemies - the moving white blood cells. Survival becomes more difficult as you and the cells enlarge and cells marked with a red "aggro circle" home in on you. Click in the game window then press Escape to both quit the game and stop the music.

If InvaderJS does not run in your current browser, please try another (such as Chrome).  </p>

    <p class="p">Control the invading bug (such as a virus) with your mouse and try to survive for as long as possible by avoiding your enemies - the moving white blood cells. To begin with, you have plenty of space in which to move and survival is easy:</p>

    <div class="p">    <div class="fig fignone"><br><div class="imagecenter"><img class="image" src="start.jpg" alt="Easy start" title="Easy start"></div><br><p class="figcapcenter">Easy start</p></div>
</div>


<p class="p">The longer you survive, the more difficult survival becomes as you and the cells enlarge and cells marked with a red "aggro circle" home in on you.</p>

</div>
 
     <p class="p">You should appreciate the smooth graphics while hearing the music for added effect. Notice the blended colours at the overlapping portions of the circles. You can quit, should you want to, by pressing Escape. Steven has thoroughly commented his code for your benefit. Clearly, he is a talented programmer and we look forward to seeing what he can produce with OpenGL.</p>
