<div id="warleyalex"><h1>SmartMS webapp with Framework7</h1>
<b>Description:</b> SmartMS + Framework7 <br>
<b>Programmer:</b> warleyalex <br>
<b>Compiler:</b> Smart Mobile Studio 2.2<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> This application was built with the Smart Mobile Studio BASIC version, as you know,  this version don't support form designer, so you have basically to create your (views) using pure html/css and then binding using the controllers (the smart units). I'm going to call this as "gambiarra" smart app. This application invoke a webservice created with Delphi mORMot to perform the authentication and call some services, thanks to suberb work by Arnauld Bouchez, interface-based service can be accessed via a SmartPascal for instance, this classes are 100% smart pascal code compatible, just to prove the power the smart pascal.
</p>
<p>
Exactly, you can have remote access to a mORMot server using SmartMobileStudio.
Just to prove that Smart Pascal is very very powerful, mORMot server will generate smart mobile compatible class (100% smart pascal), and you just drop into Smart project and voil√°, we can easy perform CRUD operations, consume SOA methods, websockets. You can even host the server on Linux OP (cheaper) and faster than Node.JS.
 
JQuery is not required. In this example, I'm using the responsive SwipeBox plugin that requires Jquery,
To run the project, a webserver is necessary because we are using Ajax; I also have included a server source to play with mORMot with some advanced tests using Smart Pascal.
